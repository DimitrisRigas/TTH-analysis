# Higgs Boson (ttH) Event Analysis with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of Higgs boson production in association with a top–antitop quark pair (ttH)
using data from the CMS experiment at CERN. The goal is to apply data analysis and machine learning techniques
to classify events and explore patterns that may indicate physics beyond the Standard Model.

The project emphasizes transferable data science skills such as high-dimensional data analysis, feature engineering,
model evaluation, and neural-based classification.
