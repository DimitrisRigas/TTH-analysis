My myClasses are the analysis codes. The first one refers to an old version where i did single leptonic analysis but later i focused on dilepton so the final one is MyClass2.C.

My reconplot.C is drawing my analysis histograms .
My mode 1 draws the Objects before the cuts etc and mode 2 draws the real analysis histograms and data who i use to reconstruct my kinematic variables. 

MY myplot.C draws the generator level histograms.

My overlay_signal_keybkgs.C draws the superimposed signal vs background and  the overlay_signal_allbkgs.C draws the signal vs all the backgrounds shown and super imposed.

My TMVAClassification.C is my neuronic multivariant trainer 

My runAnalysis.C is the macro that is running my data(signals,backgrounds etc)

Instructions on how to run each code is commented inside the code. 

Typically you just run inside root as :
